					<h4>Interest Actors</h4>

				</header>
			<span class="image left"><img src="images/interest_actors.jpeg" alt="" /></span> Social platforms and the algorithms that govern them, shape politics. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram enable individuals to share political information, engage in debates and receive messaging. The ways in which social media content is promoted, connected, and valued impacts how users and information impact public discussions, opinion making, and information salience. The unique economy of sociality and popularity on social media gives rise to a new, distinctive type of political actor who reorients the public sphere and has a unique role in politics: <em>interest actors </em>. Interest actors have relational stature with an online audience based on their expertise, authority, or professional position and engage in politics. I present the concept of interest actors, introduce a classification method for identifying interest actors on Twitter that incorporates methods that also accurately identify interest group organizations, and discuss their roles in politics and their effects on the public sphere. I demonstrate that interest actors are prominent in the information flow and collaborative networks created by interest groups. Interest actors are engaged in strategic political activities and are important to incorporate into our studies of interests activities and our general understanding of the democratic process in digital spaces.</p>

				<h4>Social Platforms and the Public Spheres</h4>
				<p>Digital Public Spaces and Opinion Formation</p>
			</header>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/socialmedianet.png" alt="" /></span>Content on social media is not filtered through the institutionalized mass media system that constrains and shapes final messages intended for the mass public. Instead, elite, interest group, elected offical opinions and frames are directly presented and accessed by the public. Social media allows these actors to contribute to these deliberation in different arenas simultaneously, not limited to a particular arena, chamber or bubble. For example, a reporter sharing opinions about a new state law may be sharing across enclaves established by race, location, or profession, but also contributing to multiple types of deliberations in 240 characters, with memes and social content. </p>

				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/interestgroups.png" alt="" /></span>How are interest groups using these spaces? What kinds of connections are they creating with one another on social platforms? These platforms enable new types of advocacy coalitions, information exchanges and group connections that give interest groups connect and exert influence over politics. Connections on social communications platforms like Twitter, allow interest groups to track, follow and share information in ways that are not limited by established organizational cooperation or policy agenda-oriented coalition participation. This allows for new operations, collaborative choices for digital political engagement, and influence. The public nature of knowing who is connected with whom suggests that connections are more complex than simply policy alignment. Social, cultural, geographical and ideological similarities can motivate organizations to follow other groups, and foster symbolic representations about the organizations' online identity. Additionally, interest groups can gain representational benefits from their connections online by cultivating an online identity reflective of the organization's cultural and social values that's visible to the public.

					<h4>Meaningful Messaging in Congressional Communication Sentiment in Elite Social Media Communication with the Public on the COVID-19 Pandemic </h4>
					<p> <em>with Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier</em> </p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mcs.png" alt="" /></span> Elite messaging plays a crucial role in shaping public debate and spreading information. We examine elite political communication during an emergent international crisis to investigate the role of tone in messaging, information spread, and public reaction. By measuring tone in social media messages from members of the United States Congress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we find clear partisan differences and a differential impact of tone on message engagement and information spread. This suggests that even in the midst of an international health crisis, partisanship and emotional rhetoric play a critical part in elite communications and contribute to the attention messages receive. The messaging on COVID-19 is polarized and fractured. The valenced messaging provokes divergence in public engagement, reaction, and information spread. These results have important implications for studies of representation, public opinion, and how government can effectively engage individuals in emergent situations or pivotal moments.</p>

					One minute speeches give members of Congress the ability to speak on any topic, for any reason. We consdier partisanship, agenda-setting, and representation using a comprhensive collection of one-minute speeches. We consider how one minute speeches are used by Members of Congress, which members or groups benefit from participating in one-minute speeches and how the use of one-minute speeches speeches changes over time. </p>
